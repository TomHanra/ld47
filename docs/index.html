It appears we may have a garderner with a penchant for knot theory, each garden is an increasingly twisted loop.</div> <br> <div>You plan to head back into the undergrowth in search of this elusive geeky gardener, where there's geeks there's organic beekeepers and lovely safe hives to start anew.</div> <br> <div>Find new bees for your swarm on flowers as they open in the safely, if strangely, maintained parts of the garden. If you take too long the plants will close their petals but there'll always be one open somewhere.</div> <br> <div>Don't leave too soon. The undergrowth is dangerous, avoid it all costs until we have enough for the hive to survive the journey. Until then, you're stuck!</div> </div> </body></html>
