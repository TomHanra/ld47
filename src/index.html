			<div>You and the last of your hive are lost!</div>
			<br/>
			<div>You're in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by strange and dangerous plants, when you stumble upon some surprisingly neat gardens in increasingly twisted loops.
				It appears we have discovered a garderner with a penchant for knot theory!</div>
			<br />
			<div>You plan to head back into the undergrowth in search of this elusive geeky gardener; where there's geeks there's organic beekeepers with lovely safe hives to live in.</div>
			<br />
			<div>Find new bees for your swarm on flowers as they open in the safe, if strangely, maintained parts of the garden. If you take too long the plants will close their petals but there'll always be one open somewhere.</div>
			<br />
			<div>Don't stray from the cleared loop the gardener has left us. The undergrowth is dangerous, avoid it all costs until we have enough for at least some of the swarm to survive the journey. Until then, you're stuck!</div>
			<br />
			<div>And finally, I'm sure this is obvious but if you bump into any of the other bees they'll sting you and you'll die. They can't help it if you're going to startle them like that!</div>
